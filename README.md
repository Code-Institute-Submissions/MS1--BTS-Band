 This project is designed to create a website as a promotional medium for the Pop-Band
 BTS. The Webpage is to draw interest and to provide basic information.

## User Experience

including existing fans as well as non-fans.

### User Stories:

* As a First time user I want to look at the Webpages on my phone screen


Developer :

* As a Developer I want to make an easy to use and understand website 

* As a Developer I want to make use of all the HTML and CSS that I learned to create a responsive website

* As a Developer I want all the features to make the website clear but attention-grabbing

#### Design: 

# Balsamic-Framework 

#### Font: 

3 different fonts were used for this Website : ["Roboto"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto), ["Playfair Display"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display?query=playfair+display)
and ["Merriweather"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather?query=merri); all which were taken from Google fonts and imported into the html file. 
These fonts were choosen after researching which fonts go well to-gether and which fonts are particularly suitable for Music/Band websites. 
All three fonts have a simple design and are easily readable.

#### Colour-palette: 

The [colour palette](https://coolors.co/ffcdb2-ffb4a2-e5989b-b5838d-6d6875) was chosen based of the Logo and the main hero-image to fit the colour-scheme.
To catch the attention of the user a contrast between white background pastel-colours were used. 

Colours:

* #b5838d,
* #e5989b,
* #ffb4a2,
* #6d6875,

The primary colour used for the website was #b5838d. It was used as background colour for the footer as well as the colour change for the menue items. As it is a darker
colour it is simple,eye-catching and goes well with a white background.
All the other colours were used throughout the websites as button backgroumd colours or as Heading colours
to highlight text. 

#### Logo & Hero-Image :

Both the logo and the hero-mage were taken off google Images and are the official logo and band picture.
The Logo comes in many versions and designs. This particular design was eye-catching and had a bright colour.
The Hero-Image was chosen for the bright pastel colours and the tone. Both the Logo and the hero-image were
first resized using the [picresize](https://picresize.com/en/results) online website before being put through tinyPNG 
for compressing the file size to the samllest size possible.

## Features 

* Feature 1 - The Navbar is very easy to navigate by clicking on the Navigation menu. When after
Menu Item is selected it is indicated to the user by the colour change of the text. Once the page is the 
one active the text-colour changes and remains as that colou until the user moves to another page,

* Feature 2 - Hyperlink Buttons are used on several of the webpages to either move the user from 
one page to another or to lead them to external links. Examples are the 'Order' and 'Buy tickets'
buttons.

* Feature 3 - A carousel slide allowing the user to view images by clicking on the next/previus button was added to 
catch the users attention and curiosity. It also allows to use multiple images without spreading them
out statically on the page.

Feature 4- A form where the user can fill in their details with their queries. It will only work if the 
user gives in a name and the correct email format together with text for the textbox area.


## Features Left to Implement

*  The Submit button of the form section does not actually link to any page or submit to anywhere.
It would be good to add a page where the submit button can link to.

* Adding an animation section to the main Home page to catch the viewers eye could maybe implemented 
in the future.

* An animation to the album-Images of the music.html page might be another feature that could be added.
The current Images are static and not very engaging,


## Technologies Used

* HTML language was used alongside Bootstrap framework for the structure of the website 

* CSS was used for the styling of the website 

* Some Imported Javascript and Jquery for styling and features.

## Testing

         ii  Menu items should change colour and become underlined

2. CTA buttons:

         i  Go to button and hover over the link.
         ii Make sure the button changes styling/colore
         iii click the link and verify that it proceeds to the correct webpage.

3. Carousel:

            i click the carousel link and verify that it changes images 
            ii verify image size is correct and buttons on carousel are centred.

4. Embedded Videos: 
          
                 i   Go to  music.html page with embedded videos 
                 ii  click on video to verify the link is working and that the video will play

5. Hyperlink Images:
  
                    i Go to music.html page with the hyperlink album-covers
                   ii click on the images and verify the link is working and connects to the correct page.
            
6. Contact form:  

                   i Go to contact-us page 
                   ii submit form with no name and verify if error message occurs
                   iii submit form with no email address and verify if error message occurs
                   iv sumbit form with no text message in box and verify if error message occurs

Project looks and works well on desktop and larger screens. However the home screen
does not fit correctly into smaller window screens. As there is two rows side by side 
below the hero image the elements do not seem to be aligning properly.
